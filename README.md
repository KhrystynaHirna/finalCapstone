* ## alternative program
Program reads in a string and makes each alternate character an uppercase character and each other alternate character a lowercase character. The program does the same with the string making each alternative word lower and upper case.
* ## calculator program
A simple calculator application that asks a user to enter two numbers and the operation (e.g. +,-,x, etc.) that they`d like to perform on the numbers. The program display the answer to the equation. Every equation entered by the user will be written to a myCalculator.txt file. The user can also to read all of the equations from a myCalculator.txt file and print out all of the equations together with the results.
* ## finance calculator
The program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
The user is allowed to choose which calculation they want to do.

***Interest formula:***

The total amount when simple interest is applied is calculated as follows: 𝐴 = 𝑃(1 + 𝑟 × 𝑡)

The total amount when compound interest is applied is calculated as follows: 𝐴 = 𝑃(1 + 𝑟)^𝑡

In the formula above:
- ‘r’ is the interest entered above divided by 100, e.g. if 8% is entered, then r is 0.08.
- ‘P’ is the amount that the user deposits.
- ‘t’ is the number of years that the money is being invested.
- ‘A’ is the total amount once the interest has been applied.
  
***Bond repayment formula:***

The amount that a person will have to be repaid on a home loan each month is calculated as follows:

𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = (𝑖 × 𝑃)/(1− (1+𝑖))^−𝑛

In the formula above:
- ‘P’ is the present value of the house
- ‘i’ is the monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12. Remember to divide the interest entered by the user by 100 e.g. (8 / 100) before dividing by 12.
- ‘n’ is the number of months over which the bond will be repaid.
